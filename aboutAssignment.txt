This is an visitor management app 
The app has a separate page for new visitor entry, and fetch pages for all entries and lastly another fetch entry based on visit reason.

Assignment 1 :
Fisrt we have tried to deploy this application using docker 

Step 1 : 
Created an EC2 (t2.micro) instance in AWS and connect it through or terminal via SSH. 

Step 2 : 
Updated the machine and installed docker, docer compose and git into the machine.

Step 3 : 
Cloned the repo into this vm 

Step 4 :
Under the security group section of aws for that instance open the inbound traffic to 5000 port from anywhere becuse python flask app runs on that port.

Step 5 : 
Ran  docker compose command to build the images 
command docker-compose up --build
Pushed the images to docker hub 

Step 6 :
Then using the public ip of the ec2 instance following by the port number we accessed the application 
<public ip>:5000
